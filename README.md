# Full Stack Open Exercises

This repository contains the solutions to the exercises from the **Full Stack Open** course, a free resource that teaches web application development using modern technologies like JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, and other popular frameworks and tools. Through this course, I have learned how to build full-stack applications, managing both the frontend and backend, handling databases, user authentication, testing, and more.

## Technologies used:
- **React** for frontend development.
- **Node.js** and **Express** for the backend.
- **MongoDB** for database management.
- **GraphQL** for efficient data querying.
- **Jest** and **Cypress** for testing.

Each folder in this repository contains the solutions to the corresponding exercises from different sections of the course. These exercises cover a wide range of topics, from basic JavaScript concepts to building complete applications using microservices architecture.
